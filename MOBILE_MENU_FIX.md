# Mobile Menu Fix for Capacitor APK

## Problem
The mobile hamburger menu was not appearing properly in the Capacitor APK build, showing only 2 misaligned menu items in portrait mode and only working correctly in landscape mode.

## Solution
Implemented enhanced mobile detection specifically for Capacitor apps that ensures the mobile menu works correctly in all orientations and screen sizes.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Header Component (`src/components/layout/Header.tsx`)
- Added Capacitor-aware mobile detection
- Replaced CSS breakpoint classes (`lg:hidden`) with dynamic state-based visibility
- Added proper CSS classes for mobile menu components
- Implemented orientation change handling

### 2. Mobile Detection Utility (`src/utils/mobileDetection.ts`)
- Created dedicated utility for mobile device detection
- Special handling for Capacitor apps vs web browsers
- Force menu visibility function for native apps
- Tablet landscape mode detection

### 3. Mobile Initialization (`src/mobile-init.ts`)
- Added orientation change event handling
- Force menu visibility on app startup
- Improved viewport handling for mobile apps

### 4. CSS Improvements (`src/index.css`)
- Added Capacitor-specific mobile menu styles
- Force mobile layout in native apps
- Improved touch targets for mobile menu button
- Landscape orientation optimizations
- Platform-specific styling for Android/iOS

## Key Features

### Capacitor-Specific Detection
- Always treats Capacitor apps as mobile unless on tablet in landscape
- Ignores standard CSS media queries in favor of JavaScript detection
- Handles orientation changes properly

### Improved Touch Targets
- Minimum 48px touch targets for mobile menu button
- Proper touch action handling
- Visual feedback on button press

### Orientation Support
- Works in both portrait and landscape modes
- Adaptive menu panel sizing based on orientation
- Special handling for small landscape screens

## Testing Instructions

1. **Build the APK:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npx cap sync android
   npx cap run android
   ```

2. **Test Scenarios:**
   - Portrait mode: Menu button should be visible and functional
   - Landscape mode: Menu should adapt to screen size
   - Orientation changes: Menu should remain functional
   - Different screen sizes: Menu should work on phones and tablets

3. **Expected Behavior:**
   - Hamburger menu button always visible in mobile view
   - Menu panel slides in from right when opened
   - All navigation links properly displayed and functional
   - Smooth transitions and proper touch feedback

## Browser Compatibility
The changes maintain full compatibility with web browsers while adding enhanced mobile app support.

## No Design Changes
All visual design elements remain unchanged - only functionality improvements for mobile app builds.
