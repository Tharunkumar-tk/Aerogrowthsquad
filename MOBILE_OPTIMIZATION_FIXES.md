# Mobile Optimization Fixes - AeroGrowthSquad APK

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Green Line at Top (Status Bar Issue)
**Problem**: Green line appearing at the top of the mobile APK, likely from status bar configuration conflicts.

**Solutions Applied**:

- Added mobile-specific header classes and responsive design
- Ensured proper visibility and opacity for mobile navigation elements

### 3. Toast Notification Positioning
